# Treasure-hunting-app

Created an app which allows people to create and execute a location-based trivia game.

A series of locations are identified. Users must decode the first trivia item, then go to that location. When they reach a certain radius from the location, the next trivia item is automatically given to them. A timer runs on the screen, the goal is to be the faster person/group to decode and visit each location in the list.
